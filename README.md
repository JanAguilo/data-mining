# Data Mining Labs

This repository contains the deliverables and implementations for the **Data Mining** course. The labs explore various data mining techniques and concepts, ranging from data preparation to advanced recommendation systems.

---

## Overview

The labs cover essential data mining techniques, helping to build a solid foundation in data preparation, pattern discovery, and recommendation systems. Each lab includes a Jupyter notebook implementing the relevant concepts with well-documented code and analysis.

## Lab Descriptions

1. **Lab 1 & 2: Data Preparation**  
   - Tasks: Data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, exploratory data analysis (EDA).
   - Goal: Prepare datasets for downstream data mining or machine learning tasks.

2. **Lab 3: Near Duplicate Detection**  
   - Tasks: Detecting near-duplicate records using algorithms like MinHash and Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH).
   - Goal: Manage redundancy efficiently in large datasets.

3. **Lab 4: Association Rules Mining**  
   - Tasks: Discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules using the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms.
   - Metrics: Support, confidence, lift.

4. **Lab 5: Content-Based Recommender Systems**  
   - Tasks: Build recommendation systems using item attributes and user preferences.
   - Techniques: Cosine similarity and vectorization of item features.

5. **Lab 6: Item-Based Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems**  
   - Tasks: Develop item-based recommendation systems leveraging user-item interaction data.
   - Techniques: Item-item similarity calculations and personalized recommendations.
